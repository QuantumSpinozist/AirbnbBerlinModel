# Airbnb Berline EDA and Modelling
I use data about airbnb listings in Berlin from 2021 (http://insideairbnb.com/) to create a predictive model for the prices.
After doing some exploratory data analysis I train an xgboost regression model on a selected subset of features, achieving 
good results. I packaged the model in a simple web application which can be seen in the other AirbnbBerlin repo.
